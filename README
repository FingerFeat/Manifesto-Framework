	What is it?
	-----------
	
	Manifesto is a web development / web design framework catered towards
	my personal workflow. I've spent a lot of time (and continue doing so)
	with improving it and getting it up to the bleeding edge of web
	craftsmanship philosophies and practices. It is built upon the foundation
	of Poul Irish et. als magnificent HTML5 Boilerplate, which is automatically
	built to work with jQuery and is generally a great starting point for
	anyone serious about developing and designing for the web. I just needed more,
	much more. So I extended the boilerplate with LESS.js, researched my ass off
	about how LESS can be manipulated into being a complete CSS3 powerhouse, 
	resulting in a LESS core framework (within this framework) that holds numerous
	nice little helper functions for a cross-browser crafting experience.
	
	The CSS has been architectured according to the principles of Jonathan Snook,
	which he describes as SMACSS (http://smacss.com/). I have taken this idea a
	bit to the extreme, would some say (at least I think), but like I said, 
	this is a framework made for myself that I want to share and further develop.
	
	Finally, I have introduced extended Snook's SMACSS methodology with a
	metaphorical approach. This approach is I call "The Author & The Manifest",
	which is simply arranging the folder structure and LESS structure as if you,
	the developer/designer, were an author of a book called "Your Current Project".
	This approach has really helped me focus on the tasks at hand and keeping many
	elements very organized and very modular.
	
	I hope you will find this framework interesting and maybe even helpful as it has
	helped me a lot already. Thank you for playing around with it and please constructively
	criticize it, so I can improve it even further.

	Why use it?
	-----------
	
	Well, no reason really. You're a professional, and professionals
	are capable of choosing between alternatives. Manifesto is one
	of many and may not be right for you. For me, it helps tremendously 
	and my clients and colleagues are happy much higher development speed
	and well-organized, modular structure.
	
	
	
	The Latest Version
	------------------

	Current: "Tiny Temper"
	
	Notes: I'm cleaning up stuff, and it is still a little messy here and there
		   so try not to go crazy over it.
	
	Details of the latest version can be found on GitHub at
	this location: http://goo.gl/WvYjn.
	
	

	Documentation
	-------------

	Since I'm a student I don't have loads of time to write lengthy documentations.
	This framework is minded to the intermediate or advanced web craftsman who
	knows his/her way around front-end coding and design. I will try to document as much
	as I can, but for now, play around, try it out and see how it goes.

	
	
	Installation
	------------

	Download the .zip file, unpack and upload to your the location of your web project.
	If you're teamed up with a developer using e.g. CodeIgniter, you should move scripts
	to the master file's head area, especially if you're in an .ASP environment. Consult
	with your developer about proper implementing LESS.
	
	As far as for the LESS structure goes, you should not have to change anything there.
	It is structured according to SMACSS, so please read about this architecture first at
	http://smacss.com/. With this in mind you only need to know the following: 
	
		I. Additional, extra, "plugin" .less files are called Leaves and are found in the Leaves
			folder. Leaves are elements you load in AFTER you've defined all the base stylings.
			For me, I create various Leaves for very custom form element designs and the likes.
			So Leaves can easily be used to create packs of stylings that gives your project a
			unique twist. Oh, and share your Leaves with others, that would be awesome.
			 
		II.  Have fun and stay awesome. Keep being visionaries of the future web. It may be
			 Manifesto, it may be something completely else. Just as long as we push forward 
			 and never stop dreaming!
			 

	
	
	
	Licensing
	---------

	Manifesto is free to use and play around with, but please don't try to sell it
	as this framework, ultimately, is built by combining frameworks made by others
	and tailored to the need of an individual.
